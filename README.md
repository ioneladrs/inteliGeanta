This app is the android application that should be used for a smart handbag.
The smart handbag is controlled by the arduino uno in first phase.
The connection between the controller part of the bag and the android app is made via Bluetooth.
For this project i have used the HC-05.

This readme file will be completed step by step, once i'm creating the features.
